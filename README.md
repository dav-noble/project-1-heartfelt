Heartfelt provides visitors with information on diversity and inclusion in the workplace or educational environment. The site provides basic information, a list of tips and best practises, and links to further resources on the topic.

## User Stories

-   As a visitor interested in diversity and inclusion, I want to see a visually appealing hero section with a compelling message, so that I immediately grasp the purpose of the webpage.

-   As a user seeking straightforward information about diversity and inclusion, I want the content divided into clearly defined sections, so that I can easily understand and digest key concepts.

-   As a user looking for actionable guidance, I want to see a list of practical tips on promoting diversity and inclusion, so that I have clear steps to follow in my workplace or educational setting.

-   As a user interested in exploring further, I want resource links styled as buttons, so that I can easily navigate to additional external materials on diversity and inclusion.

-   As a site user, I can use the navbar to easily navigate around the website.
